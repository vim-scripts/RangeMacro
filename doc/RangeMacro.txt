DESCRIPTION				       *RangeMacro-description*

Macros are a fantastic way to apply the same modification many many times.
Just record once and then repeat, repeat, repeat...

Though it's easy to repeat (|@@|, [count]@{0-9a-z".=*}) a macro, explicit
repeating becomes cumbersome when you're dealing with hundreds of repeats. You
can write a recursive macro (i.e. invoking the macro at the end), but that
will execute over the entire buffer, until the macro errors out on the border
of the buffer. Simple macros that mostly restrict themselves to a single line
can be repeated via :[range]normal @{0-9a-z".=*}, but that breaks when lines
are inserted or removed, or the macro jumps to other lines. 

What's needed for extensive macro repetitions is to repeatedly execute the
macro over a range, and stop once the macro navigates out of the range. 

This plugin provides a :RangeMacro command and mappings that execute a
recorded macro over a range, area of text covered by {motion}, or the current
seletion. 

==============================================================================
USAGE							    *RangeMacro-usage*

								 *:RangeMacro*
:[range]RangeMacro {0-9a-z".*+}
			Position the cursor on the first column of the start
			of [range] and execute the contents of register
			{0-9a-z".*+} repeatedly until the cursor moves beyond
			the lines covered by [range]. 
								   *<Leader>@*
<Leader>@{0-9a-z".*+}{motion}
			Repeatedly execute the contents of register
			{0-9a-z".*+} until the cursor moves outside the text
			covered by {motion}. 

{Visual}<Leader>@{0-9a-z".*+}
			Position the cursor on the first column of the
			selection and execute the contents of register
			{0-9a-z".*+} repeatedly until the cursor moves outside
			the selection. All selection modes are supported:
			characterwise, linewise and blockwise. 

Note: The check whether the macro moved outside the range is only done _after_
each macro invocation. During macro evaluation, jumps outside the range can be
used and will not stop macro execution. 

SUITABLE MACROS								     *

To make a macro repeatable, the macro must move to the position where the next
macro call needs to take place, typically either as the first or last command
of the macro. The macro will always be executed from top to bottom of the
range, regardless of how {motion} or the selection was made. 
So, for example, if the macro processes line(s) sequentially, append the "j"
command to move to the next line; if the buffer areas are located via
searching, you could use the "n" command to move to the next match.

INSTALLATION					     *RangeMacro-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim RangeMacro.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command. 

DEPENDENCIES					     *RangeMacro-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					    *RangeMacro-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|: 

						*g:RangeMacro_MyOption*
As there must be mappings for all supported registers, the mapping cannot be
easily customized via the <Plug> mechanism. Instead, if you prefer a different
mapping, redefine the start of the normal and visual mode mappings (before
the plugin is sourced): >
    let g:RangeMacro_Mapping = '<Leader>@'
<

LIMITATIONS					      *RangeMacro-limitations*

KNOWN PROBLEMS					   *RangeMacro-known-problems*

TODO							     *RangeMacro-todo*

- Capture original range and number of iterations to show "3 macro iterations,
  3 new lines"
- Support register = (by querying for an expression and executing that). 

IDEAS							    *RangeMacro-ideas*

- Check whether position or line contents at last position have changed versus
  last run to break endless loop?
